# Visualized-TreeMap
Wrote codes for an APP to display the structure of a file system using a visualization by implementing GUI and tree structure in.
Each file is displayed as a rectangle, whose area is proportional to the size of the object. Users can interact with the APP by clicking a file or directory in the system.
